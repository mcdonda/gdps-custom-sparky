# GDPS Custom Sparky Discord Bot

## How to set up (explained like you've never made a discord bot):

### Step 1: Creating the App

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Click on the New Application button on the top right of the page, and name it whatever you want.
Go to the Bot tab and check all of these:

You may have noticed it won't let you turn off public bot. To fix this, go to installation, under install link select 'None'. Now you can go back and make it private.
Now, to add your bot, go to the **OAuth2** section. Under OAuth2 URL Generaton, find and check the bot button.

In Bot permissions, you can just check administrator (unless you don't trust this source code for some reason). At the very bottom of the screen, in **Generated URL** there will be a URL you can type into your browser that will let you add the bot to a server.

### Step 2: Set up Discord.js stuff

Download the files for the bot and open them in VSCode (or whatever you prefer). Now you can just follow [official discord.js instructions](https://discordjs.guide/legacy/preparations/installation)
